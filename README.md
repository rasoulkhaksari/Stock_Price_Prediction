# **Stock Price Prediction**
Time-series forecasting models are the models that are capable to predict future values based on previously observed values. Time-series forecasting is widely used for non-stationary data. Non-stationary data are called the data whose statistical properties e.g. the mean and standard deviation are not constant over time but instead, these metrics vary over time.

In this project, we are going to use the Prophet mode to predict Dow Jones’s stock price in the future.

Dataset used for this project downloaded from finance.yahoo.com (2010 - 2020) https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DOW?p=DOW&.tsrc=fin-srch
